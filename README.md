Practicing programming skills to ensure, I maintain them since graduating.
Mostly consists of LeetCode and other coding problems.

Will also include any code I write for CTF's and/or code I write that I think is cool.

Goal is to not use any AI unless absolutely necessary (will mark if AI was used to write code)
